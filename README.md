# chttp

Simple HTTP library for C

This is a hobby project I did to get myself familiar with C pointers.
The library is basic and does not have extensive features.

Features:
- Create requests (with headers)
- Get responses (with headers as a mapping)

Feel free use, modify this code if you find this useful.

Known bugs:
- Don't respond well to weird headers
